Gone are the days of contending with dozens of README files just to get the right version of [helm](https://helm.sh) and to install a chart with sane defaults.

## Get arkade

```bash
# Note: you can also run without `sudo` and move the binary yourself
curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sudo sh

arkade --help
ark --help  # a handy alias

# Windows users with Git Bash
curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sh
```

> Windows users: arkade requires bash to be available, therefore Windows users can [install Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

An alias of `ark` is created at installation time, so you can also run `ark install APP`

## Usage

Here's a few examples of apps you can install, for a complete list run: `arkade install --help`.

* `arkade install` - install an app
* `arkade info` - the post-install screen for an app
* `arkade get` - install a CLI tool such as `kubectl` or `faas-cli`
* `arkade update` - print instructions to update arkade itself

### Install an app

No need to worry about whether you're installing to Intel or ARM architecture, the correct values will be set for you automatically.

```bash
arkade install openfaas --gateways 2 --load-balancer false
```

### Install a CLI tool

arkade will determine the correct URL to download a CLI tool of your choice taking into account for your Operating System and CPU architecture - whether Intel or ARM.

```bash
arkade get kubectl
arkade get faas-cli
arkade get kubectx
arkade get helm
```

> This is a time saver compared to searching for download pages every time you need a tool.

Think of `arkade get TOOL` as a doing for CLIs, what `arkade install` does for helm.

#### Reduce the repetition

[Normally up to a dozen commands](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) (including finding and downloading helm), now just one. No searching for the correct CRD to apply, no trying to install helm, no trying to find the correct helm repo to add:

```bash
arkade install cert-manager
```

Other common tools:

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx

arkade install metrics-server
```

#### Bye-bye values.yaml, hello flags

We use strongly typed Go CLI flags, so that you can run `--help` instead of trawling through countless Helm chart README files to find the correct `--set` combination for what you want.

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx --help

Install ingress-nginx. This app can be installed with Host networking for
cases where an external LB is not available. please see the --host-mode
flag and the ingress-nginx docs for more info

Usage:
  arkade install ingress-nginx [flags]

Aliases:
  ingress-nginx, nginx-ingress

Examples:
  arkade install ingress-nginx --namespace default

Flags:
      --helm3              Use helm3, if set to false uses helm2 (default true)
  -h, --help               help for ingress-nginx
      --host-mode          If we should install ingress-nginx in host mode.
  -n, --namespace string   The namespace used for installation (default "default")
      --update-repo        Update the helm repo (default true)
```

#### Override with `--set`

You can also set helm overrides, for apps which use helm via `--set`

```bash
ark install openfaas --set=faasIdler.dryRun=false
```

After installation, an info message will be printed with help for usage, you can get back to this at any time via:

```bash
arkade info <NAME>
```

#### Get a self-hosted TLS registry with authentication

Here's how you can get a self-hosted Docker registry with TLS and authentication in just 5 commands on an empty cluster:

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx
arkade install cert-manager
arkade install docker-registry
arkade install docker-registry-ingress \
  --email web@example.com \
  --domain reg.example.com
```

#### Get OpenFaaS with TLS

The same for OpenFaaS would look like this:

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx
arkade install cert-manager
arkade install openfaas
arkade install openfaas-ingress \
  --email web@example.com \
  --domain reg.example.com
```

#### Get a public IP for a private cluster and your IngressController

And if you're running on a private cloud, on-premises or on your laptop, you can simply add the [inlets-operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator/) using [inlets-pro](https://docs.inlets.dev/) to get a secure TCP tunnel and a public IP address.

```bash
arkade install inlets-operator \
  --access-token $HOME/digitalocean-token \
  --region lon1 \
  --license $(cat $HOME/license.txt)
```

## Community & contributing

### Suggesting a new app

To suggest a new app, please check past issues and [raise an issue for it](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade). Think also whether your app suggestion would be a good candidate for a Sponsored App.

### Sponsored apps

As of May 2020, you can propose your project or product as a Sponsored App. Sponsored Apps work just like any other app that we've curated, however they will have a note next to them in the app description `(sponsored)` and a kink to your chosen site upon installation. An app sponsorship can be purchased for a minimum of 12 months and includes free development and support of the app for arkade.

When your sponsorship expires your app can be renewed at that time, or it will disappear automatically based upon the end-date.

Email [sales@openfaas.com](mailto:sales@openfaas.com) to find out more.

### How does `arkade` compare to `helm`?

In the same way that [brew](https://brew.sh) uses git and Makefiles to compile applications for your Mac, `arkade` uses upstream [helm](https://helm.sh) charts and `kubectl` to install applications to your Kubernetes cluster. arkade exposes strongly-typed flags for the various popular options for helm charts, and enables easier discovery through `arkade install --help` and `arkade install APP --help`.

### What is in scope for `arkade get`?

Generally speaking, tools that are used with the various arkade apps or with Kubernetes are in scope. If you want to propose a tool, raise a GitHub issue.

What about package management? `arkade get` provides a faster alternative to package managers like `apt` and `brew`, you're free to use either or both at the same time.

### Automatic download of tools

When required, tools, CLIs, and the helm binaries are downloaded and extracted to `$HOME/.arkade`.

If installing a tool which uses helm3, arkade will check for a cached version and use that, otherwise it will download it on demand.

Did you accidentally run arkade as root? **Running as root is not required**, and will mean your KUBECONFIG environment variable will be ignored. You can revert this using [the notes on release 0.1.18](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade/releases/tag/0.1.8).

### Improving the code or fixing an issue

Before contributing code, please see the [CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/alexellis/inlets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Note that arkade uses the same guide as [inlets.dev](https://inlets.dev/).

Both Issues and PRs have their own templates. Please fill out the whole template.
