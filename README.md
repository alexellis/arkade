# arkade - get Kubernetes apps, the easy way

Gone are the days of contending with dozens of README files just to get the right version of [helm](https://helm.sh) and to install a chart with sane defaults. arkade (ark for short) provides a clean CLI with strongly-typed flags to install charts and apps to your cluster in one command.

## What about helm and `k3sup`?

In the same way that brew uses git and Makefiles to compile applications for your Mac, `arkade` uses upstream [helm](https://helm.sh) charts and kubectl to install applications to your Kubernetes cluster.

On k3sup vs. arkade: The codebase in this project is derived from `k3sup`. [k3sup (ketchup)](https://k3sup.dev/) was developed to automate building of k3s clusters over SSH, then gained the powerful feature to install apps in a single command. The presence of the word "k3s" in the name of the application confused many people, this is why arkade has come to exist.

And yes, of course it works with k3s and where possible, apps are available for ARM.

## Get arkade

```bash
curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sh
sudo install arkade /usr/local/bin/

arkade --help
```

An alias of `ark` is created at installation time.

## Usage

Here's a few examples of apps you can install, for a complete list run: `[ark]ade install --help`.

### Install an app

```bash
[ark]ade install openfaas --gateways 2 --load-balancer false

[ark]ade install cert-manager

[ark]ade install nginx-ingress

[ark]ade install metrics-server

[ark]ade install inlets-operator --access-token $HOME/digitalocean --region lon1
```

You can also set helm overrides, for apps which use helm via `--set`

```
ark install openfaas --set=faasIdler.dryRun=false
```

After installation, an info message will be printed with help for usage, you can get back to this at any time via:

```bash
arkade app info <NAME>
```

### Get a self-hosted TLS registry with authentication

Here's how you can get a self-hosted Docker registry with TLS and authentication in just 5 commands on an empty cluster:

```bash
arkade install nginx-ingress
arkade install cert-manager
arkade install docker-registry
arkade install docker-registry-ingress \
  --email web@example.com \
  --domain reg.example.com
```

### Get OpenFaaS with TLS

The same for OpenFaaS would look like this:

```bash
arkade install nginx-ingress
arkade install cert-manager
arkade install openfaas
arkade install openfaas-ingress \
  --email web@example.com \
  --domain reg.example.com
```

### Get a public IP for a private cluster and your IngressController

And if you're running on a private cloud, on-premises or on your laptop, you can simply add the [inlets-operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator/) using [inlets-pro](https://docs.inlets.dev/) to get a secure TCP tunnel and a public IP address.

```bash
arkade install inlets-operator \
  --access-token $HOME/digitalocean-token \
  --region lon1 \
  --license $(cat $HOME/license.txt)
```

### Tools and cached versions of helm

When required, tools, CLIs, and the helm binaries are downloaded and extracted to `$HOME/.arkade`.

If installing a tool which uses helm3, arkade will check for a cached version and use that, otherwise it will download it on demand.
