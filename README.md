# arkade - The Open Source Kubernetes Marketplace

arkade provides a portable marketplace for downloading your favourite devops CLIs and installing helm charts, with a single command.

You can also download CLIs like `kubectl`, `kind`, `kubectx` and `helm` faster than you can type "apt-get/brew update".

With over 40 helm charts and apps available for Kubernetes, gone are the days of contending with dozens of README files just to set up a development stack with the usual suspects like ingress-nginx, Postgres and cert-manager.

## Should you try arkade?

Here's what [Ivan Velichko](https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1422605221226860548?s=20), SRE @ Booking.com has to say about arkade:

> I was setting up a new dev environment yesterday. Kind, helm, kustomize, kubectl, all this stuff. My take is - arkade is highly underappreciated.
> I'd spend an hour in the past to install such tools. With arkade it was under ten minutes.

[Greg](https://twitter.com/cactusanddove) runs Fullstack JS and is a JavaScript developer, he says:

> This is real magic get #kubernetes up and going in a second; then launch #openfaas a free better than lambda solution that uses docker images.

[@arghzero](https://twitter.com/ArghZero/status/1346097288851070983?s=20) says:

> for getting the basics installed, nothing beats arkade
> it can install commonly used cli tools like kubectl locally for you, as well as common k8s pkgs like ingress-nginx or portainer

[@Yankexe](https://twitter.com/yankexe/status/1305427718050250754?s=20) says:

> It's hard to use K8s without Arkade these days.
> My team at @lftechnology absolutely loves it.

From [Michael Cade @ Kasten](https://twitter.com/MichaelCade1/status/1390403831167700995?s=20)

> I finally got around to installing Arkade, super simple!
> quicker to install this than the argocli standalone commands, but there are lots of handy little tools in there.
> also, the neat little part about arkade, not only does it make it easy to install a ton of different apps and CLIs you can also get the info on them as well pretty quickly.

## Get arkade

```bash
# Note: you can also run without `sudo` and move the binary yourself
curl -sLS https://get.arkade.dev | sudo sh

arkade --help
ark --help  # a handy alias

# Windows users with Git Bash
curl -sLS https://get.arkade.dev | sh
```

> Windows users: arkade requires bash to be available, therefore Windows users can [install Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

An alias of `ark` is created at installation time, so you can also run `ark install APP`

## Usage

Here's a few examples of apps you can install, for a complete list run: `arkade install --help`.

* `arkade install` - install an app
* `arkade info` - the post-install screen for an app
* `arkade get` - install a CLI tools such as `kubectl` or `faas-cli`
* `arkade update` - print instructions to update arkade itself

### Install a CLI tool

arkade downloads the correct version of a CLI for your OS and CPU.

With automatic detection of: Windows / MacOS / Linux / Intel / ARM.

```bash
arkade get APP
arkade get APP --version VERSION
arkade get APP@VERSION

# Download multiple tools at once
arkade get APP1 APP2 APP3

arkade get APP1 APP2@VERSION APP3

# Override machine os/arch
arkade get APP --arch ARCH --os OS
```

Note to contributors, run `arkade get --output markdown` to generate this list

> This is a time saver compared to searching for download pages every time you need a tool.

Think of `arkade get TOOL` as a doing for CLIs, what `arkade install` does for helm.

Adding a new tool for download is as simple as editing [tools.go](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade/blob/master/pkg/get/tools.go).

### Create a Kubernetes cluster

If you have Docker installed, then you can install Kubernetes using KinD in a matter of moments:

```bash
arkade get kubectl
arkade get kind

kind create cluster
```

You can also download k3d [k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) in the same way with `arkade get k3d`.

### Install an app

No need to worry about whether you're installing to Intel or ARM architecture, the correct values will be set for you automatically.

```bash
arkade install openfaas --gateways 2 --load-balancer false
```

Remember how awkward it was last time you installed the [Kubernetes dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard)? And how you could never remember the command to get the token to log in?

```bash
arkade install kubernetes-dashboard
```

Forgot your token? `arkade info kubernetes-dashboard`

Prefer [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io)? Just run: `arkade install portainer`

### Uninstall an app

Run `arkade uninstall` or `arkade delete` for more information on how to remove applications from a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Reduce the repetition

[Normally up to a dozen commands](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) (including finding and downloading helm), now just one. No searching for the correct CRD to apply, no trying to install helm, no trying to find the correct helm repo to add:

```bash
arkade install cert-manager
```

Other common tools:

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx

arkade install metrics-server
```

#### Bye-bye values.yaml, hello flags

We use strongly typed Go CLI flags, so that you can run `--help` instead of trawling through countless Helm chart README files to find the correct `--set` combination for what you want.

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx --help

Install ingress-nginx. This app can be installed with Host networking for
cases where an external LB is not available. please see the --host-mode
flag and the ingress-nginx docs for more info

Usage:
  arkade install ingress-nginx [flags]

Aliases:
  ingress-nginx, nginx-ingress

Examples:
  arkade install ingress-nginx --namespace default

Flags:
  -h, --help               help for ingress-nginx
      --host-mode          If we should install ingress-nginx in host mode.
  -n, --namespace string   The namespace used for installation (default "default")
      --update-repo        Update the helm repo (default true)
```

#### Override with `--set`

You can also set helm overrides, for apps which use helm via `--set`

```bash
ark install openfaas --set faasIdler.dryRun=false
```

After installation, an info message will be printed with help for usage, you can get back to this at any time via:

```bash
arkade info <NAME>
```

#### Get a self-hosted TLS registry with authentication

Here's how you can get a self-hosted Docker registry with TLS and authentication in just 5 commands on an empty cluster:

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx
arkade install cert-manager
arkade install docker-registry
arkade install docker-registry-ingress \
  --email web@example.com \
  --domain reg.example.com
```

#### Get OpenFaaS with TLS

The same for OpenFaaS would look like this:

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx
arkade install cert-manager
arkade install openfaas
arkade install openfaas-ingress \
  --email web@example.com \
  --domain reg.example.com
```

#### Get a public IP for a private cluster and your IngressController

And if you're running on a private cloud, on-premises or on your laptop, you can simply add the [inlets-operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator/) using [inlets PRO](https://docs.inlets.dev/) to get a secure TCP tunnel and a public IP address.

```bash
arkade install inlets-operator \
  --access-token $HOME/digitalocean-token \
  --region lon1 \
  --license $(cat $HOME/license.txt)
```


#### Explore the apps

You can view the various apps available with `arkade install / --help`, more are available when you run the command yourself.

```bash
arkade install --help
ark --help

Examples:
  arkade install
  arkade install openfaas --helm3 --gateways=2
  arkade install inlets-operator --token-file $HOME/do-token
```

### Suggest a new app

To suggest a new app, please check past issues and [raise an issue for it](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade). Think also whether your app suggestion would be a good candidate for a Sponsored App.

### Sponsored apps

You can now propose your project or product as a Sponsored App. Sponsored Apps work just like any other app that we've curated, however they will have a note next to them in the app description `(sponsored)` and a link to your chosen site upon installation. An app sponsorship can be purchased for a minimum of 12 months and includes free development of the Sponsored App, with ongoing support via GitHub for the Sponsored App for the duration only. Ongoing support will be limited to a set amount of hours per month.

When your sponsorship expires the Sponsored App will be removed from arkade, and the ongoing support will cease. A Sponsored App can be renewed 60 days prior to expiration subject to a separate agreement and payment.

Example:

```bash
arkade VENDOR install PRODUCT
arkade acmeco install dashboard
```

Current sponsored apps include:

* [Venafi](https://venafi.com) for Machine Identity:

  ```bash
  arkade venafi install --help
  arkade venafi info --help
  ```

* [Kasten (k10)](https://kasten.io) for Kubernetes backup and restore:

  ```bash
  arkade kasten install --help
  arkade install k10 \
    --set eula.accept=true \
    --set clusterName=my-k10 \
    --set prometheus.server.enabled=false
  arkade kasten info k10
  ```

[Contact us](mailto:contact@openfaas.com) to find out how you can have your Sponsored App added to arkade.

### How does `arkade` compare to `helm`?

In the same way that [brew](https://brew.sh) uses git and Makefiles to compile applications for your Mac, `arkade` uses upstream [helm](https://helm.sh) charts and `kubectl` to install applications to your Kubernetes cluster. arkade exposes strongly-typed flags for the various popular options for helm charts, and enables easier discovery through `arkade install --help` and `arkade install APP --help`.

### Is arkade suitable for production use?

If you consider helm suitable, and `kubectl` then yes, arkade by definition uses those tools and the upstream artifacts of OSS projects.

Do you want to run arkade in a CI or CD pipeline? Go ahead.

### What is in scope for `arkade get`?

Generally speaking, tools that are used with the various arkade apps or with Kubernetes are in scope. If you want to propose a tool, raise a GitHub issue.

What about package management? `arkade get` provides a faster alternative to package managers like `apt` and `brew`, you're free to use either or both at the same time.

### Automatic download of tools

When required, tools, CLIs, and the helm binaries are downloaded and extracted to `$HOME/.arkade`.

If installing a tool which uses helm3, arkade will check for a cached version and use that, otherwise it will download it on demand.

Did you accidentally run arkade as root? **Running as root is not required**, and will mean your KUBECONFIG environment variable will be ignored. You can revert this using [the notes on release 0.1.18](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade/releases/tag/0.1.8).
