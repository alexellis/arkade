# arkade - Open Source Marketplace For Developer Tools

arkade is how developers install the latest versions of their favourite tools and Kubernetes apps.

With `arkade get`, you'll have `kubectl`, `kind`, `terraform`, and `jq` on your machine faster than you can type `apt-get install/brew update`.

## Demo

![demo](https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-7Fyg69mwbYHFuUtSKnWMYT.gif)

## Getting arkade

```bash
# Note: you can also run without `sudo` and move the binary yourself
curl -sLS https://get.arkade.dev | sudo sh

arkade --help
ark --help  # a handy alias

# Windows users with Git Bash
curl -sLS https://get.arkade.dev | sh
```

> Windows users: arkade requires bash to be available, therefore Windows users should [install and use Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

An alias of `ark` is created at installation time, so you can also run `ark install APP`

## Usage overview

Arkade can be used to install Kubernetes apps or to download CLI tools.

* `arkade install` - install a Kubernetes app
* `arkade info` - see the post installation screen for a Kubernetes app
* `arkade get` - download a CLI tool
* `arkade update` - perform a self-update of arkade on MacOS and Linux

An arkade "app" could represent a helm chart such as `openfaas/faas-netes`, a custom CLI installer such as `istioctl` or a set of static manifests (i.e. MetalLB).

An arkade "tool" is a CLI that can be downloaded for your operating system. Arkade downloads statically-linked binaries from their upstream locations on GitHub or a the vendor's chosen URL such as with `kubectl` and `terraform`.

> Did you know? Arkade users run `arkade get` both on their local workstations, and on their CI runners such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

## Download CLI tools with arkade

arkade downloads the correct version of a CLI for your OS and CPU.

With automatic detection of: Windows / MacOS / Linux / Intel / ARM.

```bash
# Download a binary release of a tool

arkade get kubectl

# Download a specific version of that tool
arkade get kubectl@v1.22.0

# Download multiple tools at once
arkade get kubectl \
  helm \
  istioctl

# Download multiple specific versions
arkade get faas-cli@0.13.15 \
  kubectl@v1.22.0

# Override machine os/arch
arkade get faas-cli \
  --arch arm64 \
  --os linux

# Override machine os/arch
arkade get faas-cli \
  --arch arm64 \
  --os darwin
```
> This is a time saver compared to searching for download pages every time you need a tool.

Files are stored at `$HOME/.arkade/bin/`

Want to download tools to a custom path such as into the GitHub Actions cached tool folder?

```bash
arkade get faas-cli kubectl \
  --path $HOME/runner/_work/_tools

# Usage:
/runner/_work/_tools/faas-cli version

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/runner/_work/_tools
faas-cli version
```

Think of `arkade get TOOL` as a doing for CLIs, what `arkade install` does for helm.

Adding a new tool for download is as simple as editing [tools.go](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade/blob/master/pkg/get/tools.go).

[Click here for the full catalog of CLIs](#catalog-of-clis)

## Install System Packages

System packages are tools designed for installation on a Linux workstation, server or CI runner.

These are a more limited group of applications designed for quick setup, scripting and CI, and generally do not fit into the `arkade get` pattern, due to additional installation steps or system configuration.

```bash
# Show packages
arkade system install

# Show package flags
arkade system install go --help

# Install latest version of Go to /usr/local/bin/go
arkade system install go

# Install Go 1.18 to /tmp/go
arkade system install go \
  --version 1.18 \
  --path /tmp/

# Install containerd for ARM64, 32-bit ARM or x86_64
# with systemd enabled
arkade system install containerd \
  --systemd
```

Run the following to see what's available `arkade system install`:

```
  actions-runner  Install GitHub Actions Runner
  buildkitd       Install Buildkitd
  cni             Install CNI plugins
  containerd      Install containerd
  firecracker     Install Firecracker
  gitlab-runner   Install Gitlab Runner
  go              Install Go
  node            Install Node.js
  prometheus      Install Prometheus
  tc-redirect-tap Install tc-redirect-tap
  registry        Install Open Source Registry implementation for storing and distributing container images using the OCI Distribution Specification
```

The initial set of system apps is now complete, learn more in the original proposal: [Feature: system packages for Linux servers, CI and workstations #654](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade/issues/654)

## Install CLIs during CI with GitHub Actions

* [alexellis/arkade-get@master](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade-get)

Example downloading faas-cli (specific version) and kubectl (latest), putting them into the PATH automatically, and executing one of them in a subsequent step.

```yaml
    - uses: alexellis/arkade-get@master
      with:
        kubectl: latest
        faas-cli: 0.14.10
    - name: check for faas-cli
      run: |
        faas-cli version
```

If you just need system applications, you could also try "setup-arkade":

* [alexellis/setup-arkade@master](https://github.com/alexellis/setup-arkade)

```yaml
    - uses: alexellis/setup-arkade@v2
    - name: Install containerd and go
      run: |
        arkade system install containerd
        arkade system install go
```

## Verify and upgrade images in Helm charts

There are two commands built into arkade designed for software vendors and open source maintainers.

* `arkade helm chart upgrade` - run this command to scan for container images and update them automatically by querying a remote registry. 
* `arkade helm chart verify` - after changing the contents of a values.yaml or docker-compose.yaml file, this command will check each image exists on a remote registry

Whilst end-users may use a GitOps-style tool to deploy charts and update their versions, maintainers need to make conscious decisions about when and which images to change within a Helm chart or compose file.

These two features are used by OpenFaaS Ltd on projects and products like OpenFaaS CE/Pro (Serverless platform) and faasd (docker-compose file). 

### Upgrade images within a Helm chart

With the command `arkade chart upgrade` you can upgrade the image tags of a Helm chart from within a values.yaml file to the latest available semantically versioned image.

Original YAML file:

```yaml
stan:
  # Image used for nats deployment when using async with NATS-Streaming.
  image: nats-streaming:0.24.6
```

Running the command with `--verbose` prints the upgraded tags to stderr, allowing the output to stdout to be piped to a file.

```bash
arkade chart upgrade -f \
  ~/go/src/github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/chart/openfaas/values.yaml \
  --verbose

2023/01/03 10:12:47 Verifying images in: /home/alex/go/src/github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/chart/openfaas/values.yaml
2023/01/03 10:12:47 Found 18 images
2023/01/03 10:12:48 [natsio/prometheus-nats-exporter] 0.8.0 => 0.10.1
2023/01/03 10:12:50 [nats-streaming] 0.24.6 => 0.25.2
2023/01/03 10:12:52 [prom/prometheus] v2.38.0 => 2.41.0
2023/01/03 10:12:54 [prom/alertmanager] v0.24.0 => 0.25.0
2023/01/03 10:12:54 [nats] 2.9.2 => 2.9.10
```

Updated YAML file printed to console:

```yaml
stan:
  # Image used for nats deployment when using async with NATS-Streaming.
  image: nats-streaming:0.25.2
```

Write the updated image tags back to the file:

```bash
arkade chart upgrade -f \
  ~/go/src/github.com/openfaas/faasd/docker-compose.yaml \
  --write
```

Supported:

* `image:` - at the top level
* `component.image:` i.e. one level of nesting
* Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry

Not supported yet:
* Custom strings that don't match the word "image": `clientImage: `
* Split fields for the image and tag name i.e. `image.name` and `image.tag`
* Third-level nesting `openfaas.gateway.image`

## Verify images within a helm chart

The `arkade chart verify` command validates that all images specified are accessible on a remote registry and takes a values.yaml file as its input.

Successful checking of a chart with `image: ghcr.io/openfaas/cron-connector:TAG`:

```bash
arkade chart verify  -f ~/go/src/github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/chart/cron-connector/values.yaml

echo $?
0
```

There is an exit code of zero and no output when the check passed.

You can pass `--verbose` to see a detailed view of what's happening.

Checking of nested components, where two of the images do not exist `autoscaler.image` and `dashboard.image`:

```bash
arkade chart verify  -f ~/go/src/github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/chart/openfaas/values.yamlecho $?
2 images are missing in /Users/alex/go/src/github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/chart/openfaas/values.yaml

COMPONENT           IMAGE
dashboard           ghcr.io/openfaasltd/openfaas-dashboard:0.9.8
autoscaler          ghcr.io/openfaasltd/autoscaler:0.2.5

Error: verifying failed

echo $?
1
```

Supported:

* `image:` - at the top level
* `component.image:` i.e. one level of nesting

Not supported yet:
* Custom strings that don't match the word "image": `clientImage: `
* Split fields for the image and tag name i.e. `image.name` and `image.tag`
* Third-level nesting `openfaas.gateway.image`

## Installing apps with arkade

You'll need a Kubernetes cluster to arkade. Unlike cloud-based marketplaces, arkade doesn't have any special pre-requirements and can be used with any private or public cluster.

### Create a Kubernetes cluster

If you have Docker installed, then you can install Kubernetes using KinD in a matter of moments:

```bash
arkade get kubectl@v1.22.0 \
  kind@v0.11.1

kind create cluster
```

You can also download k3d [k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) in the same way with `arkade get k3d`.

### Install a Kubernetes app

No need to worry about whether you're installing to Intel or ARM architecture, the correct values will be set for you automatically.

```bash
arkade install openfaas \
  --gateways 2 \
  --load-balancer false
```

The post-installation message shows you how to connect. And whenever you want to see those details again, just run `arkade info openfaas`.

There's even more options you can chose with `arkade install openfaas --help` - the various flags you see map to settings from the helm chart README, that you'd usually have to look up and set via a `values.yaml` file.

If there's something missing from the list of flags that you need, arkade also supports `--set` for any arkade app that uses helm. Note that not every app uses helm.

Remember how awkward it was last time you installed the [Kubernetes dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard)? And how you could never remember the command to get the token to log in?

```bash
arkade install kubernetes-dashboard
```

Forgot your token? `arkade info kubernetes-dashboard`

This is an example of an arkade app that uses static YAML manifests instead of helm.

Prefer [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io)? Just run: `arkade install portainer`

### Uninstall an app

Run `arkade uninstall` or `arkade delete` for more information on how to remove applications from a Kubernetes cluster.

### Reduce the repetition

[Normally up to a dozen commands](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) (including finding and downloading helm), now just one. No searching for the correct CRD to apply, no trying to install helm, no trying to find the correct helm repo to add:

```bash
arkade install cert-manager
```

Other common tools:

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx

arkade install metrics-server
```

### Say goodbye to values.yaml and hello to flags

We use strongly typed Go CLI flags, so that you can run `--help` instead of trawling through countless Helm chart README files to find the correct `--set` combination for what you want.

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx --help

Install ingress-nginx. This app can be installed with Host networking for
cases where an external LB is not available. please see the --host-mode
flag and the ingress-nginx docs for more info

Usage:
  arkade install ingress-nginx [flags]

Aliases:
  ingress-nginx, nginx-ingress

Examples:
  arkade install ingress-nginx --namespace default

Flags:
  -h, --help               help for ingress-nginx
      --host-mode          If we should install ingress-nginx in host mode.
  -n, --namespace string   The namespace used for installation (default "default")
      --update-repo        Update the helm repo (default true)
```

### Override with `--set`

You can also set helm overrides, for apps which use helm via `--set`

```bash
ark install openfaas --set faasIdler.dryRun=false
```

After installation, an info message will be printed with help for usage, you can get back to this at any time via:

```bash
arkade info <NAME>
```

### Compounding apps

Apps are easier to discover and install than helm chart which involve many more manual steps, however when you compound apps together, they really save you time.

#### Get a self-hosted TLS registry with authentication

Here's how you can get a self-hosted Docker registry with TLS and authentication in just 5 commands on an empty cluster:

Here's how you would bootstrap OpenFaaS with TLS:

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx
arkade install cert-manager
arkade install openfaas
arkade install openfaas-ingress \
  --email web@example.com \
  --domain openfaas.example.com
```

And here's what it looks like for a private Docker registry with authentication enabled:

```bash
arkade install ingress-nginx
arkade install cert-manager
arkade install docker-registry
arkade install docker-registry-ingress \
  --email web@example.com \
  --domain reg.example.com
```

#### Get a public IP for a private cluster and your IngressController

And if you're running on a private cloud, on-premises or on your laptop, you can simply add the [inlets-operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator/) using [inlets](https://docs.inlets.dev/) to get a secure TCP tunnel and a public IP address.

```bash
arkade install inlets-operator \
  --access-token $HOME/digitalocean-token \
  --region lon1 \
  --provider digitalocean
```

This makes your cluster behave like it was on a public cloud and LoadBalancer IPs go from Pending to a real, functioning IP.

### Explore the apps

You can view the various apps available with `arkade install / --help`, more are available when you run the command yourself.

```bash
arkade install --help
ark --help

Examples:
  arkade install
  arkade install openfaas --helm3 --gateways=2
  arkade install inlets-operator --token-file $HOME/do-token
```

### Suggest a new app

To suggest a new app, please check past issues and [raise an issue for it](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade). Think also whether your app suggestion would be a good candidate for a Sponsored App.

## Sponsored apps

You can now propose your project or product as a Sponsored App. Sponsored Apps work just like any other app that we've curated, however they will have a note next to them in the app description `(sponsored)` and a link to your chosen site upon installation. An app sponsorship can be purchased for a minimum of 12 months and includes free development of the Sponsored App, with ongoing support via GitHub for the Sponsored App for the duration only. Ongoing support will be limited to a set amount of hours per month.

When your sponsorship expires the Sponsored App will be removed from arkade, and the ongoing support will cease. A Sponsored App can be renewed 60 days prior to expiration subject to a separate agreement and payment.

Example:

```bash
arkade VENDOR install PRODUCT
arkade acmeco install dashboard
```

[Contact OpenFaas Ltd](mailto:contact@openfaas.com) to find out how you can have your Sponsored App added to arkade.

## FAQ

### How does `arkade` compare to `helm`?

In the same way that [brew](https://brew.sh) uses git and Makefiles to compile applications for your Mac, `arkade` uses upstream [helm](https://helm.sh) charts and `kubectl` to install applications to your Kubernetes cluster. arkade exposes strongly-typed flags for the various popular options for helm charts, and enables easier discovery through `arkade install --help` and `arkade install APP --help`.

### Is arkade suitable for production use?

If you consider helm suitable, and `kubectl` then yes, arkade by definition uses those tools and the upstream artifacts of OSS projects.

Do you want to run arkade in a CI or CD pipeline? Go ahead.

### What is in scope for `arkade get`?

Generally speaking, tools that are used with the various arkade apps or with Kubernetes are in scope. If you want to propose a tool, raise a GitHub issue.

What about package management? `arkade get` provides a faster alternative to package managers like `apt` and `brew`, you're free to use either or both at the same time.

### Automatic download of tools

When required, tools, CLIs, and the helm binaries are downloaded and extracted to `$HOME/.arkade`.

If installing a tool which uses helm3, arkade will check for a cached version and use that, otherwise it will download it on demand.

Did you accidentally run arkade as root? **Running as root is not required**, and will mean your KUBECONFIG environment variable will be ignored. You can revert this using [the notes on release 0.1.18](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade/releases/tag/0.1.8).
